  	   <h3>Here are some facts about The Gambia</h3>
  	     <ul>
  	     	<li> <b>1965 </b> The Gambia got it's independence from the united ingdom</li>

  	     	<li><b>Geography</b> The Gambia is a very small and narrow country whose borders mirror the meandering Gambia River. It lies between latitudes 13 and 14°N, and longitudes 13 and 17°W.</li>
  	     	<li><b>Climate</b> Gambia has a tropical climate. A hot and rainy season normally lasts from June until November, but from then until May, cooler temperatures predominate, with less precipitation</li>
  	     	<li><b>Militery</b> The Gambian Armed Forces consist of the Gambian National Army, Republican Guards comprising a well-trained and bequipped Presidential Guards and the Special Forces, and the Navy, all under the authority of the Ministry of Defence</li>

  	     	<li><b>Society</b> The urbanisation rate in 2011 was 57.3%. Provisional figures from the 2003 census show that the gap between the urban and rural populations is narrowing as more areas are declared urban</li>

Islam is the predominant religion, practised by 96% of the country's population. The majority of the Muslims in the Gambia adhere to Sunni laws and traditions</li>
